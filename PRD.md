# Square Component Library

## Overview

A comprehensive component library showcase for Square, featuring an elegant interface to browse, preview, and understand reusable UI components.

## User Stories

### Primary Users
- **Developers**: Need to quickly find and implement components in their projects
- **Designers**: Want to see component variations and design patterns
- **Product Managers**: Need to understand available UI patterns

### Core User Stories
- As a developer, I want to browse all available components in one place
- As a developer, I want to see live examples of each component
- As a designer, I want to see component variations and states
- As a user, I want to search for specific components quickly
- As a user, I want to filter components by category
- As a developer, I want to see code examples for implementation

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **State Management**: React Context for global state
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation

### Design System
- **Colors**: Square-inspired palette (blues, greens, neutrals)
- **Typography**: Clean, readable font hierarchy
- **Spacing**: Consistent 8px grid system
- **Components**: Reusable UI primitives

### Core Features
- Component showcase grid/list view
- Individual component detail pages
- Search functionality
- Category filtering
- Responsive design
- Code snippet display
- Interactive component demos

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] Project setup and configuration
- [ ] Design system implementation
- [ ] Basic layout and navigation
- [ ] Component data structure
- [ ] Main components listing page

### Phase 2: Component Infrastructure
- [ ] Individual component showcase pages
- [ ] Search and filtering system
- [ ] Category organization
- [ ] Code snippet display
- [ ] Documentation sections

### Phase 3: Enhancement
- [ ] Interactive component demos
- [ ] Advanced filtering options
- [ ] Component usage analytics
- [ ] Export/sharing functionality
- [ ] Mobile optimization

## Data Model

### Component Structure
```typescript
interface Component {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  tags: string[];
  component: React.ComponentType;
  codeExample: string;
  props?: ComponentProps;
  variants?: ComponentVariant[];
}

interface ComponentCategory {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  components: Component[];
}
```

## File Structure
```

├── components/
│   ├── ui/           # Reusable UI components
│   ├── layout/       # Layout components

├── hooks/           # Custom hooks
└── utils/           # Utility functions
```

## Success Metrics
- Easy component discovery (< 3 clicks to find any component)
- Clear component understanding (visual + code examples)
- Responsive design across all devices
- Fast loading times (< 2s initial load)
- Intuitive navigation and search

## Future Considerations
- Component versioning
- Usage documentation
- Design tokens integration
- Automated component generation
- Integration with design tools
